This repository discuss about the Travelling Salesman Problem with the usage of 2-opt algorithm and Christofides algorithm. Exploring and comparing these algorithms, then create a merged algorithm that combine both algorithm's advantages to solve the problem in a more balanced way by balancing their runtime and stability.
